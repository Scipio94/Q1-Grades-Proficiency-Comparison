# Q1 Grades Proficiency Comparison
A small charter school network has been having issues with proficiency in both Math and ELA on their local diagnostic exams which they are paying 20,757.50 USD to implement as well as state tests. In an effort to evaluate the curriculum and rigor of their grading scale and academic practices, the goal of this project is to compare overall proficinecy in all subjects, as well as Math and ELA to the proficiency metrics on their local diagnostic exams for the first quarter of the 2023-2024 academic school year.
